# Icons

Place your extension icons here:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px (browser toolbar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32px (Windows taskbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store, installation)

You can generate these from a single high-resolution image using online tools or image editors.

## Recommended Design

- Use simple, recognizable designs
- Ensure good contrast against both light and dark backgrounds
- Test visibility at small sizes (16x16)
- Follow platform guidelines for icon design
